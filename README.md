# folio

A super simple, no-fuss personal portfolio. I put this together fast—just wanted a place to showcase my work without overthinking things or adding unnecessary complexity.

## What’s in here?

- `index.html` – The main page for the portfolio.
- `style.css` – Styles for a clean, minimal look.
- `script.js` – Powers basic interactivity.
- `data.json` – Contains portfolio entries and info.
